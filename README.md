## 🎯 Introduction
**Project-Name : TBot (Agentic AI-Powered Tax-Bot)**
Tax calculation is often complex and time-consuming due to varying tax laws, exemptions, and deductions. Individuals and businesses frequently seek guidance on tax-related queries but struggle with navigating multiple PDFs, tax codes, and government regulations. A chatbot powered by AI can simplify this process by providing instant, accurate, and user-friendly tax assistance.

**Problem Statement :**
Develop an AI-powered Tax Calculation Chatbot using LangChain and an LLM, integrated with Streamlit for an interactive UI. The chatbot should retrieve relevant information from a large set of tax-related PDFs (>20) and assist users by:

Answering tax-related questions accurately.
Providing real-time tax calculations based on user inputs.
Handling different tax categories (e.g., income tax, corporate tax, deductions, and exemptions).
Offering an easy-to-use interface with a visually appealing design.

**Objectives :**
Implement agent-driven document retrieval and tax calculations.
Enable dynamic query interpretation with follow-up question handling.
Provide an interactive Streamlit UI for seamless user experience.

**Expected Outcome :**
An AI-driven tax assistant that automates tax calculations, answers queries accurately, and simplifies tax compliance.
